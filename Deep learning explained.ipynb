    "# What Is Deep Learning?\n",
    "Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning that uses algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain's neural networks.With deep learning, we're still talking about algorithms that learn from data just like we discussed in the last post on machine learning. However, now the algorithms or models that do this learning are based loosely on the structure and function of the brain's neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neural networks that we use in deep learning aren't actual biological neural networks though. They simply share some characteristics with biological neural networks, and for this reason, we call them artificial neural networks (ANNs).We often also use other terms to refer to ANNs. In the field of deep learning, the term artificial neural network (ANN) is used interchangeably with the following:\n",

    "ANNs are built using what we call neurons.\n",

    "In the previous post, we defined deep learning as a sub-field of machine learning that uses algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain's neural networks. For this reason, the models used in deep learning are called artificial neural networks (ANNs).Let's give a definition for an artificial neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "An artificial neural network is a computing system that is comprised of a collection of connected units called neurons that are organized into what we call layers.The connected neural units form the so-called network. Each connection between neurons transmits a signal from one neuron to the other. The receiving neuron processes the signal and signals to downstream neurons connected to it within the network. Note that neurons are also commonly referred to as nodes.Nodes are organized into what we call layers. At the highest level, there are three types of layers in every ANN:\n",

    "Different layers perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Data flows through the network starting at the input layer and moving through the hidden layers until the output layer is reached. This is known as a forward pass through the network. Layers positioned between the input and output layers are known as hidden layers.\n",
    "Let's consider the number of nodes contained in each type of layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input layer - One node for each component of the input data.\n",
    "Hidden layers - Arbitrarily chosen number of nodes for each hidden layer.\n",
    "Output layer - One node for each of the possible desired outputs.\n",
    "This ANN has three layers total. The layer on the left is the input layer. The layer on the right is the output layer, and the layer in the middle is the hidden layer. Remember that each layer is comprised of neurons or nodes. Here, the nodes are depicted with the circles, so let's consider how many nodes are in each layer of this network.\n",

    "Number of nodes in each layer:\n",

    "Hidden layer (middle): 3 nodes\n",
    "Output layer (right): 2 nodes\n",

    "\n",
    "Since this network has two nodes in the output layer, this tells us that there are two possible outputs for every input that is passed forward (left to right) through the network. For example, overweight or underweight could be the two output classes. Note that the output classes are also known as the prediction classes."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "First we import the required Keras classes.\n",
    "Then, we create a variable called model, and we set it equal to an instance of a Sequential object.\n",
    "To the constructor, we pass an array of Dense objects. Each of these objects called Dense are actually layers.\n",
    "The word dense indicates that these layers are of type Dense. Dense is one particular type of layer, but there are many other types that we will see as we continue our deep learning journey.\n",
    "For now, just understand that dense is the most basic kind of layer in an ANN and that each output of a dense layer is computed using every input to the layer.The first parameter passed to the Dense layer constructor in each layer tells us how many neurons it should have.\n",
    "The input shape parameter input_shape=(2,) tells us how many neurons our input layer has, so in our case, we have two.\n",
    "Lastly, we have a parameter for a so-called activation function.\n",
    "activation='relu'\n",
    "activation='softmax'\n",
    "More on this in future posts. For now, just know that an activation function is a non-linear function that typically follows a dense layer.\n",
    "This gives us an example of a very basic model definition in Keras. For a more in depth look at Keras, be sure to check out the Keras series. For now, I hope you have an idea for what an ANN is and how you can build one using Keras. I hope you found this one helpful. See ya in the next one!\n",
